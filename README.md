1. [Detecting Bot Behaviour in Social Media using Digital DNA Compression](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2563/aics_35.pdf)
   - Assuming that bot behave less randomly comparing to humans, the paper measures the randomness and unpredictability in the posting behavior via a lossless compression algorithm on the Digit DNA sequence of the account
   - Steps:
      - Represent account with Digit DNA
      - Deploy a lossless compression on the Digit DNA
      - Based on the compression statistics, differentiate real users from bots via ML alg
